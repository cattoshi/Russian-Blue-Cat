RBCAT is a deflationary token with 2% auto burn mechanism that had its ownership renounced and given to the community upon its creation. This decentralization of power has allowed RBCAT to flourish as a 100% community-driven project that receives markedly engaged holders and rapid growth on a daily basis. It has become a unique social experiment in which the investors are integrated into the project both from a community and developmental standpoint.

Released SEPTEMBER 21, 2024 on the Binance Smart Chain network, the RBCAT project has been iteratively built and improved upon by volunteers within the community since its inception. Graphic designers, writers, web developers, influencers, marketers, data analysts, translators, and more have contributed their talents to help RBCAT grow into an inspirational model of community-driven success.

With so much progress achieved by its community in such a short amount of time, Pitbull stands as a solid milestone in this progressive, exciting age of the Social Blockchain.
